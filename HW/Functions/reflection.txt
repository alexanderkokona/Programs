Please respond thoroughly (at least two sentences for each question) to
the following three questions.

1. Describe an experience you had this semester where you saw the power of
functions.
When I nestled my first function within a function to perform an automated task. 
I realized then that if made correctly, I could create anything and the program would do whatever I wanted.


2. In your judgment, what is the value of test functions?
In my own personal opinion, the value of test functions depends on your willingness to make and use them.
If you take the test functions seriously, they are invaluable and provide true confidence in your program.
If you don't, then you lose confidence in the program and have a significantly higher chance of having
buggy programs.


3. Describe your process for troubleshooting and fixing a program that
has a problem. What is one thing you can do to improve your process?
I first try to find the line that has the issue and see if I can nip the bug in the bud.
If I can't I read through the appropriate parts of the code to see if it's outside
the line specified. If I still can't find it, I run the debugger, and if all else fails 
I turn to a peer or AI.
To improve, I could just go straight to the debugger, which would cut down on guess work and time.
